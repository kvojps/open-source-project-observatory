# Security Policy

## Supported Versions

We only add security updates to the latest MAJOR.MINOR version of the project. No security updates are backported to previous versions.

## Reporting a Vulnerability

If you've found a security vulnerability with the Plausible codebase, you can disclose it responsibly by sending a summary to josebazjunior09@gmail.com. We will review the potential threat and fix it as fast as we can.

While we do not have a bounty program in place yet, we are incredibly thankful for people who take the time to share their findings with us. Whether it's a tiny bug that you've found or a security vulnerability, all reports help us to continuously improve Plausible for everyone. Thank you!
